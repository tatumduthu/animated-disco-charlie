- Project no. 3 in CIS 376 with starter help from Dr. Barry Cumbie

## ðŸ¤©Dev-Charlie-Project
- This project is the third project I completed in my CIS 376 web development course. It is a website that dislays a dashboard for the first two web projects I made in this class. The first project displayed is a parking app, and the second project displayed is a bedroom layout.
### âœ¨Code snippet
- This code is for the toggle between showing and hiding the navigation menu links when the user clicks on the hamburger menu
```json
function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myLinks");
  if (x.style.display === "block") {
    x.style.display = "none";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "block";
  }


```
### âœ¨Code snippet
- This is code for the first card that displays my parking app project
```json
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h4 class="card-title">Parking Blog</h4>
        <img class="card-img-top img-thumbnail" src="images/parkingAppPreview.png" alt="Card image">
        <p class="card-text"> My first web dev project where I did this little blog! </p>
        <a href="pages/parkingApp.html" target="parking" class="card-link">Parking App</a>
        <a href="pages/parkingAppSource.html" target="parking" class="card-link">source code</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

```
